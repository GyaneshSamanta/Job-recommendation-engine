### Next-Gen ML Research for ischoolconnect
#### Inspiration💡

With students opting for higher studies in foreign universities, it is important for them to understand the categories and specifics of kobs that they'll be able to opt in for once completing their higher studies. For the same, we use a kaggle data set on job openings and attempt to understand the qualifications required for the jobs and recommend jobs based on user inputs. 

#### What it does 🧭

The Job recommendation engine has 2 major functionality in terms of its working 

 - Take in current job as an input and recommend jobs that require a similar skillset
 - Take in parameters as user qualifications, education and experience to recommend jobs based on other people's history with jobs 


#### How we built it 🔧

The solution was built using jupyter notebook, python and multiple python libraries. 

#### Tech Stack 🔨
1. Python
2. Kaggle
3. Machine learning models
4. Git
5. GitHub

#### Challenges we ran into 🏃‍♂️

1. There was a major difference in a list of all types of jobs around the world and the list of current job openings. This led to inaccurate recommendations when it came to Non-IT based jobs as accounting, janitors and more. 

2. 
#### Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏅
1. The function to recommend similar jobs to people works as per it's specifications
2. The recommendation engine's accuracy while working with Computer science, developer and IT jobs was found to be satisfactory. 

#### What we learned 🧠
1. Working in a multi ethnic and multi diverse team around the globe
2. Real time collaboration with developers all around the world
3. Setting up deadlines and working with set objectives to ensure a timely delivery. 

#### What's next ⏭
 1. For future additions we aim to improve the recommendation system by collecting data of the list of jobs available wth the asoociated qualifications necessary for it.
